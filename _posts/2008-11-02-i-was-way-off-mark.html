Damn.  I got the wrong info from somewhere about dynamic audio and XNA - there is NO support for loading audio at runtime through XNA 3. <br /><br />That was the main thing I've been looking forward to :(<br /><br />Of course, if you don't care about running on the xbox, you can use any audio engine accessible from c# (fmod, wmp etc)
