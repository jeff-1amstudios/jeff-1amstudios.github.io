Good news - the original UI is implemented, using the original textures and buttons! It was pretty fiddly getting everything in the right place and looking right, but its done.

I've taken screenshots including the window border because its pretty hard now to tell apart from the original:

I've changed the Race selection window so instead of choosing from a boring list of track names, you get to see the screenshot and description:![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZeDb9Fkk2X0/TITuuOx8C8I/AAAAAAAAAEw/M8PrDeLRqLs/select-race-screen.jpg)

In the car selection screen I actually render the 3d model instead of using the 2d artwork. There is only artwork for the drivable cars in the original game, and since you can drive all cars in the remake, that is a problem! Using the 3d models also means addon cars work better, so im happy enough with it :)
