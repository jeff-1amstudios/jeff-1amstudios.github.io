I'm tired after a night of coding, so I'll just post some screenshots now and maybe add some details later...

The first one shows off the almost finished special volume support in the Magnachem industrial zone.  The  windscreen is using the specvol reflection, and the water doesn't have  much gravity (which is why I'm doing a wheelie)

These next ones are even more fun!  Yep, opponents are here :)  They don't do anything yet, just sit there in a nice grid. This weekend I want to implement the opponent paths and get them following the race track around.  I love this screenshot, because when I was browsing around my screenshots to upload it to the blog, I missed it at first thinking it was a screenshot I took with the original game :)  Awesome!  Sleep time now...
