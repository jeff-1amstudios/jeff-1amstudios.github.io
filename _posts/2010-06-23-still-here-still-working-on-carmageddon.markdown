Still here, still working on OpenCarma (slowly...).  I've recently hooked up overall car damage, with smoke and fire animations and jerky engine power as you get more damaged. The smoke goes from light grey to dark grey to black.    The fire effects use an animated billboard which I'll be re-using for the pedestrians.
