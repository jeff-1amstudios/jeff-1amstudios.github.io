So I meant to post this a couple of weeks back, but things have been pretty crazy busy with moving to San Francisco from New Zealand.

OpenC1 1.4 is available now from [http://www.1amstudios.com/projects/openc1](http://www.1amstudios.com/projects/openc1)

Changes

*   Downloads and uses free C1 demo, SplatPack demo and SplatPack Xmas demo content
*   Fixed (for real this time) ATi rendering issues
*   Lots of small bugs
*   Added pedestrian gibs
*   Added support for some strange SplatPack .pix files
*   Fixed gameplay issues like being awarded credits and time for the AI running over peds

Edit: OpenC1 1.4 source code now available on [http://code.google.com/p/openc1](http://code.google.com/p/openc1). Go check it out!
