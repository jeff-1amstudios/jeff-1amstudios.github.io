I am looking at writing an open-source Carma 1 engine in c# :)

Currently after a couple of nights of work I have models loading (no texturing yet) - so this includes cars and tracks.

A long time ago I wrote a .pix (texture) viewer in QBasic - I dont have the code or any memory of the file format now but should be able to figure it out.

This one is obviously Otis, but the hump in the middle of the roof is the wheel model which somehow ended up there... I'll have to figure that one out!
