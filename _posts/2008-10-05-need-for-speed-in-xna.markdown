As the title suggests, I'm working on an XNA-powered Need for Speed game.

It reads in the original Need for Speed 1 data files (using specs found [here](http://auroux.free.fr/nfs/nfsspecs.txt)) and renders it out in full XNA goodness - 1024x768, anti-aliasing, motion blur etc.

I thought it would be an interesting test - would an amateur using XNA be able to replicate a 10 year old game, which for its time was pretty groundbreaking?)

The jury's still out on that one, but so  far I have a complete track and vehicle renderer, complete with animating scenery and skybox.

I am currently working on the car physics, using [this](http://hamboeck.blogspot.com/2008/03/marco-monsters-car-physics-demo-in-xna.html) as a starting point.
