XNA 2.0's lack of dynamic audio - no ContentManager.Load&lt;Audio&gt;<audio>(filename) - is a real problem for XNA Need for Speed.<br /><br />All resources are loaded from the Need For Speed binary files at runtime, which works fine for models and textures, but not audio.<br /><br />I have code to dynamically generate a wave file from the sound data contained in the Need for Speed soundbank files, but right now its useless as theres no way to load the wave file.<br /><br />All that is going to change in XNA 3.  The CTP is out right now, but my friend Sharky (of <a href="http://sharky.bluecog.net/">Air Legends</a> fame) pointed me to a <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-us/xna_goes_live_october30th">page</a> where the official release date has been announced as October 30th.  As in 9 days away :)<br /><br />This should also see the XNA NES emulators suddenly get audio support.</audio>
