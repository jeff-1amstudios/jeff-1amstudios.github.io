I'm 90% of the way to figuring out the crush data! :)  I spent all day on it yesterday (literally from waking up to now late at night), and have got to the point where i just need to figure out what a few more numbers do before I can implement it in the engine. As far as I know, this is the first time the crush data has been understood.
