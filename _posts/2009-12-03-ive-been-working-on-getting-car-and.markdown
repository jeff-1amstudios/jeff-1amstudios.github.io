In carmageddon-speak, Grooves are model animations, and Funks are texture animations.

Grooves are done.
Funks are half done (_flic, roll_ funks implemented, still need to do _slither, throb and frames_)

Will take another video tonight :) 

After spending more time than I should have to get grooves working properly, (Ivan's swinging motor which has a swinging blade really nailed me for a while!) it turns out only a few cars and tracks actually use them :(
