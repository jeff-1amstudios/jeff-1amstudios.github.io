I spoke about RESTful-DOOM at an [API meetup](https://www.meetup.com/apidiscovery) a couple of weeks ago!  

RESTful-DOOM embeds an API into the classic 1993 first person shooter game, allowing the it to be queried and controlled using HTTP and JSON. [More details here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-01-restful-doom %}).
