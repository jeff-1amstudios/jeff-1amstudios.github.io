Thanks for all the feedback, I didnt know so many people were watching my progress!

I think I know what the problem is with the demo release - one of the dlls was compiled in 'Debug' mode, which means unless your machine is setup to develop software you won't have the required files. There will be a new release tomorrow morning which should work for everyone. :)

Thanks for letting me know 1amstudios is realllly slow at the moment. I've asked GoDaddy to investigate - waiting to hear back from them, so it might be a while...
