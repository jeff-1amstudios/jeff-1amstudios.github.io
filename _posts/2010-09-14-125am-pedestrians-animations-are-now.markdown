I've partly hooked up the pedestrian animations - yay! I've mostly done the 'standing around' and 'running' ones. Next I'll need to implement the paths (so they can actually move), then the rest of the animations. In the screenshot you can see the texture co-ords also aren't quite right - the black line above the shoulders obviously shouldn't be there.
