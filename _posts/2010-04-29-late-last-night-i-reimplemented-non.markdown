(Late) last night I re-implemented what are called 'NonCars' in Carmageddon.  They include phyiscs objects like trees, lampposts, benches etc that you can bend, break, then push around with your car. My previous version could break them, but at the time I couldn't figure out to get PhysX to allow them to bend.

Working on the crush stuff gave me an idea how to do it, and it works :) I spent half an hour just bending lampposts after getting it working
