I had to take a bit of a break from this project as real life and other commitments have been a bit neglected!

But last night I started hooking up the car models to the PhysX physics model (previously ive been using a box with wheels), and using the real wheel positions and sizes.  So for example Dumpy does a bit of a wheelie when starting to accelerate, and Firestorm is really hard to drive :)  Its great to see a few behaviors that remind me of the original game.
