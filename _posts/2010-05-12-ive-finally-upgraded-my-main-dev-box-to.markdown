I've finally upgraded my main dev box to Win7 from WinXP (which I've used for the last 10 years!). I skipped Vista entirely, and only upgraded now because I figured I should. So between work, life and upgrade problems I havent done anything on OpenCarma lately. So theres really no point to this blog post :)
