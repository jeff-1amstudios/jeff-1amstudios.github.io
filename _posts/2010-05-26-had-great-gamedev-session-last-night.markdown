Had a great gamedev session last night with my mate [lawrence](http://sharky.bluecog.co.nz/).   Were both working on XNA projects and it really helps motivation to have someone else kicking your ass for not getting stuff done and helping find bugs.   Rock Band, funny movies, coffee and game coding... awesome :)

I fixed an annoying bug thats stopped me getting on with 3d audio - some sounds played at 2x the volume of other sounds, and it was pretty random when it happened.  Pre-loading all the sounds before the game starts (instead of loading them the first time they're needed) fixed it. Not sure why that fixed it but glad to be back in gamedev mode!
