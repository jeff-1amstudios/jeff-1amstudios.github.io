It has been a year now since I started working at [MuleSoft](http://www.mulesoft.com/)!

I spend my day in a mixture of coding (mainly NodeJS and Java), whiteboarding, standups, tracking down issues, sprint planning (often with the help of pizza). Its been a great year and I feel like I've learned a ton about building reliable distributed systems. Best of all there are lots of smart, friendly people to learn from :)

We're always [hiring](https://www.mulesoft.com/careers), so contact me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/1amstudios) or [github](https://github.com/jeff-1amstudios) and I'll be happy to answer any questions!
