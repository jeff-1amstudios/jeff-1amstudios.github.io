Yay, more screenshots. In this one, the Eagle has been smashed hard at the front a bunch of times.   The vertices are pushed back right to the limits - it wont crush any further.  It needs more tuning, it doesn't look quite right to me

After more tuning, heres Otis deformed before and after. The white dots are the vertices we look at on collision to see if and how the car should be deformed.
