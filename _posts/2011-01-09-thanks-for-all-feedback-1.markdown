Thanks everyone

Changes:

*   New setting "Disable culling" which should fix cars being partially invisible if you have an ATi card
*   More logging (to log.txt) which includes files opened and crash information.
*   OpenC1.pdb included in zip file. This means more detailed crash information will be generated to help diagnose problems.

Please submit problems to the Issues list at [http://code.google.com/p/openc1/issues](http://code.google.com/p/openc1/issues). It will help to keep all problems visible.
