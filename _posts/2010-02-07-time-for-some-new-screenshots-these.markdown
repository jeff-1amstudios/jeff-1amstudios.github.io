Time for some new screenshots!  These show material modifiers (which affect bumpiness, skidmarks, tyre smoke, slipperiness etc), and cockpits (no steering animations or controls yet)

The first screenshot shows the default material - white tyre smoke and black skidmarks. I love the skidmarks :)

In this one, the grass material has green skidmarks, is bumpy, and if you look closely, green tyre smoke (its easier to see in game).

This one shows the Eagle skidding along the frozen lake in the winter map. White smoke and white skid marks, and very slippery.

And now a couple of cockpit views.  It took ages to figure out the placement of the cockpit image (the dashboard/steering wheel) compared to the 3d bonnet model, but comparing screenshots of the original game to these I think I've got it as good as I'm going to ever get it.  There are some pretty cryptic lines in the car file describing the placement and configuration of the speedo and tacho - I think for now I'll get the steering wheel actually steering then leave it for now.
