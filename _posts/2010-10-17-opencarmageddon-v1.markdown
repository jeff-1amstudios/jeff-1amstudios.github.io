OpenCarmageddon v1.1 is [here](http://www.1amstudios.com/download/OpenC1_11.zip)

I'm pretty sure I've fixed the problem everyone has been having - but let me know! If you have a crash, there might be a crash.txt file in the main folder. If so, send it to me jeff@1amstudios.com.  Also, check out the readme.txt before trying to run it. I've listed another dependency that some people might need.
