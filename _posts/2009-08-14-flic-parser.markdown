Tonight I wrote a flic file parser. [Flic](http://www.compuphase.com/flic.htm) files are animation files. Handling compressed frames was a bit tricky, but it was good fun.  In Carmageddon flic files are used for various texture animations in the UI and in game. Looking through the Data\Anim folder, I found some funny images that were obviously used during development before being replaced with the final versions. I just love hidden stuff :)
