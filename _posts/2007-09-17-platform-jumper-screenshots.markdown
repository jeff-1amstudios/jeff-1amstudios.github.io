Platform Jumper is a fun little game I've been working on for the last week.  The aim is to jump around the blocks with an FPS view and pick up all the coins.  There are some special blocks, like Bouncers and Elevators.

I've been working on it for about a week and a half to learn XNA.  I have previously used DirectX and C++ so most of the concepts are familiar.

I'm finding XNA is a really nice library to code against compared to DirectX.  Things like Mouse.GetState() and Keyboard.GetState() just make sense.  Its many, many more lines of code with DirectX to get the same result.

Heres a couple of screenshots
