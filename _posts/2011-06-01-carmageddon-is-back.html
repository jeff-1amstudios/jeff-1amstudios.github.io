Now its official news I can tell you guys - Stainless Software has got the rights back to the whole Carmageddon series!! &nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>There is a new Carmageddon game in the works, and for me, no more Square Enix legal threats! &nbsp;There is also a possibility of the original game being re-released for modern Windows system which personally I am pretty excited about :)</div><div><br /></div><div>So check out the new <a href="http://carmageddon.com/">carmageddon.com</a>&nbsp;and get involved on the community forums!</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not sure exactly what this means for OpenC1 - as you can tell development has stopped for a while and I'm working on other projects, but I've been talking to Stainless on and off for a while and they are pretty supportive which is great!</div>
