Heres the latest video.  It shows grooves and funks on both cars and tracks.

It also shows some signs being pushed over. That part doesn't work like the original game yet, where they should bend a certain amount before detaching.  PhysX isn't playing nicely with the necessary joint constraints to make that happen at the moment...
