I'm not happy with the JigLibX results, and I don't see much active development on it. I'm looking at a couple of different physics library options.  Right now I am evaluating PhysX (through the [StillDesign C# wrapper](http://www.codeplex.com/physxdotnet)). I also want to check out Havok.

Im sure it won't be perfect (game physics is at best a black art!) but i've seen a few videos on youtube where PhysX looks great. And being owned(?) by Nvidia, its bound to be more actively developed and supported than ODE/JigLib/etc.
