        iPhone Disk Drive is a free program which adds your iPhone or iPod Touch as a removable drive in Windows. 
        This means you can use it like a normal usb stick to copy files between computers or for backups.
        <br><br>
        <p>What happens when I have iPhone Disk Drive installed?</p>

        iPhone Disk Drive sits in your system tray and waits for a device to be connected. Once it detects a device, a drive is added
        in My Computer, and you can copy/add/remove any files or folders on the device, straight through Windows Explorer.

        <br><br>
        <p>How does it work?</p>

        iPhone Disk Drive implements a virtual file system to allow iPhone files to be opened and 
        edited through standard Windows APIs.  The virtual file system implementation uses <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/">Dokan</a>.
        <br>
        If the iPhone is jailbroken, the full filesystem will be mounted, but jailbreaking is not required.
        <br><br>
        Large files are copied quickly by batching multiple read and write calls from Windows to optimize I/O to the iPhone. Each connected
        iPhone is handled by a separate worker process to separate the UI and each virtual filesystem.
        <br>
        
        <br>It is better than most of the similar tools because it actually mounts the iPhone as 
        a drive, allowing you to use standard Windows tools. (Explorer, notepad, etc.)  <br>
