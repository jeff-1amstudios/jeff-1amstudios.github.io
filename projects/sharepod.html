<div class="alert alert-success">SharePod was acquired by Macroplant LLC in 2013 and is no longer available from 1amstudios.com</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-7 post-content">
        
        <p>I first started building SharePod around 2005 when I got my first iPod - a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3G_ipod_in_dock.jpg">3rd gen</a>. iTunes wasn't even available for Windows, and instead it came with MusicMatch Jukebox plus an iPod plugin - a really nasty solution!</p>
        <p>I hated MusicMatch, and was familiar with hex editors from editing games, so I got to work reverse engineering the iPod's custom database file.  Back then there was no database encryption, which made it much easier.</p>

        <p>The free, final 3.9.9 version supported these features:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Edit music and videos</li>
            <li>Edit playlists</li>
            <li>Edit album art</li>
            <li>View and backup photos</li>
            <li>Copy music, videos and playlists from your iPod to PC and back to iPod</li>
            <li>Import music and videos into your iTunes library, including playlists and ratings</li>
            <li>Tag editing</li>
            <li>Drag-drop between SharePod and Explorer</li>
            <li>Simple, clean, quick to load and use with no unnessary complicated features</li>
            <li>Support for iPhone and iTouch (Thanks to Nikias Bassen, Paul Sladen, Jonathan Beck, and Christophe Fergeau for making this possible)</li>
        </ul>

<h4>SharePod is actually two projects - the SharePod app and SharePod-lib</h4>
SharePod-lib is a .Net library providing all the functionality to discover and interact with iPod/iPhone devices, which the SharePod app used. SharePod-lib was sold as a licensable component, or as source code.  Price ranged from $99-$399.
<br>

<ul>
    <li>Automatically find connected iPods. </li>
    <li>Enumerate and edit tracks, playlists, album artwork</li>
    <li>Access and backup photo albums</li>
    <li>Support for all iPods - iPhone, iPod Touch, iPod Shuffle, Mini, 3G, 4G (Photo), 5G (Video), 6G (Classic, Nano) </li>
    <li>Copy tracks from an iPod to computer.</li>
    <li>Support for complex databinding to Windows Forms controls. </li>
    <li>Eject iPod from PC. </li>
</ul>

<br />

Sample code:

{% highlight c# %}
/*
