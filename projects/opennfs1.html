        OpenNFS1 is an open-source rewrite of the original Need for Speed 1 game
        by Pioneer Studios and EA. The code is written in C#, using <a href="http://www.monogame.net/">
            Monogame</a>. The code was written from scratch, but uses the original Need for Speed data (textures, models, tracks).
        Information on the file formats was <a href="http://auroux.free.fr/nfs/nfsspecs.txt">
            reverse engineered</a> by Denis Auroux (mostly) and myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        I wanted to do this for a couple of reasons: To learn more about 3D coding, to play
        NFS1 again (the original won't run on modern Windows), and as to see if its possible
        to replicate (a small amount!) of a groundbreaking old game using modern tools.
        <br />
        <br />
        While working on OpenNFS1, I learnt a lot of tricks and really came to appreciate
        the skill of the original programmers. These days computers have so much space and
        power, us programmers can often get away with being lazy. Back in 1995 things were
        different...
        <br />
        For example, the texture of track fence and also where the fence is located is all packed
        into a single byte.  The top 2 bits define the sides of the road the fence is on, and the lower 6 bits define the texture id. Pretty cool stuff!
        <br />
        <br />
        In this version, you can race around every track, with basic vehicle and engine
        physics, collision detection and sound. There is no collision detection for traffic or racers
        in this version.
